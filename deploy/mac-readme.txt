Before running Canvas Sync for the first time, open a terminal window
and run

```
xattr -c 'Canvas Sync.app'
```

first. Otherwise there will be an error saying that this app is
developed by an unidentified developer, but that's just me, the dev.

If you've dragged-and-dropped Canvas Sync into the /Applications
folder already, simply run

```
xattr -c '/Applications/Canvas Sync.app'
```

instead. Enjoy!
